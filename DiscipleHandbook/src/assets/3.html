<h1>Life in the Spirit</h1>

    <h2>1. Worship</h2>
    <h3>
        Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise (Psalms 100:4 (NIV))
        </h2>
        <p>
            Worship is about acknowledging who God is.
            We place our situation in context of <strong>whose</strong> we are.
            When we worship through song, we declare with our mouths that Jesus is our Lord and savior and He is greater
            than the situation that we face.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why do we worship God?
        </h3>
        <p>Philippians 2:9-11 says:</p>
        <p>
            9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
            and gave him the name that is above every name,
            10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
            in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
            11 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
            to the glory of God the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, we worship Jesus because He is worth our worship. Our lives are enriched by His love for us.
            It’s an honor to worship Jesus and to experience His presence.

        2. Read the Bible Daily
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you already have a Bible, open it up and start reading!
        Some Study Bibles will have a Subject Guide in the back of the Bible.
        Study Bibles also clarify the Bible and provide additional context.
        Don’t have a Bible? The Bible is online @ <a href="https://www.bible.com"
            target="_blank">https://www.bible.com</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>3. Work the word </h2>
    <p> God’s word is satisfying. You don’t always need to read many verses, but if you work the same verse or
        chapter over and over, He can interpret it for you. It is more important to fully understand the word God is
        speaking to you through His Word. Allow The Spirit to guide your understanding. </p>
